# COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Prediction

This project analyzes psychological and demographic predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance using survey data collected in 2022.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The goal of this project was to explore which psychological and sociodemographic variables best predict the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

- Dataset: N = 580 respondents (Germany)
- Data collection: SoSci Survey (online questionnaire)
- Methods: multiple Regression
- Performance: RÂ² = .77
- Tools: R (car, psych, jtools, olsrr, moments, lmtest, lsr)

## ðŸ§  Research Focus
- Examined the influence of trust in democratic processes, attitudes toward public broadcasting, and political orientation.
- Investigated how individual differences in psychological and socio-cultural variables affect vaccination willingness.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- The group of unvaccinated individuals is not as homogeneous as often portrayed. Considerable variance in political attitudes â€” on average politically neutral.
- Common denominator: a general critical stance toward institutions.
- Sociocultural differences: Vaccinated participants tend to be more left-leaning, show greater trust in democratic processes, and hold more positive attitudes toward public media.
- Individuality-related variables showed only small but meaningful effects.
